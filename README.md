# StrangeAttractors
Particle Visualisation of Strange Attractors. 

This OpenGL Program is used to display the behaviour of attractors. It is still very much work in progress. 

To-Do:
Add Custom Functions
Practical User Interface and Mouse Events
Pump up graphics (maybe add own shader, eventhough not needed)
Overwrite Attractor Class
Check memory Issues with ObjCreator Class
