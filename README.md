# StrangeAttractors
Particle Visualisation of Strange Attractors. 

This OpenGL Program is used to display the behaviour of attractors. It is still very much work in progress. 

To-Do:
- Add Custom Functions 
- Practical User Interface and Mouse Events
- Pump up graphics (maybe add own shader, eventhough not needed)
- Overwrite Attractor Class
- Check memory Issues with ObjCreator Class
- switch from Euler computation to Runge-Kutta4 (maybe)
